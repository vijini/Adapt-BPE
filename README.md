This repository contains the scripts and code associated with the paper:

**"AdaptBPE: From General Purpose to Specialized Tokenizers"** 

The scripts implement **post-training BPE merge refinement** algorithms and experimental setups described in the paper. They allow you to replicate the tokenization, merge selection, and evaluation experiments on various datasets and languages.
